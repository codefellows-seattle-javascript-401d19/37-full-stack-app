## Purpose
A RESTful API for uploading, altering, and saving wav files

## Set Up
1. Clone the repo into whatever directory you choose
2. 'npm i' (to install all dependencies)
3. 'npm run webpack' to build the page
4. follow the link provided see the webpage
5. Create an .env file with the following information:
  * note: you will need to have an AWS account to use this program
  PORT=3000
  MONGODB_URI='<your mongo uri>'
  DEBUG=true
  CORS_ORIGINS='<one or more cors origins>'
  SECRET_SALT='a random string'
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your aws access key id'
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='you aws secret access key'
  AWS_BUCKET='the name of the bucket you created on AWS'
6. 'npm run dbon' to start MongoDB
7. 'npm run start' to start the server

## API Resourcs
  User Model: The user model is used for authorization and authentication when interacting with other resources (profile, wav files). It contains:
    * _id: a unique id generated by the database for identifying the user
    * username: a unique string
    * email: a unique string with a valid email format
    * passwordHash: a string of the hashed password used to verify the user
    * passwordSalt: the random 64 byte hex string generated for hashing with the password to improve security
    * tokenSeed: a unique string used for creating authentication tokens
  Wav Model:
    * _id: a unique id generated by the database for identifying the wav file
    * user: 
    * wavename:
    * url: r
    * transform:
  Profile Model: Authorization is required to create or update a profile; profiles cannot be deleted. Each user has a single profile containing:
    * _id: a unique id generated by the database for identifying the profile
    * owner: the user id of the account
    * bio: a string holding the user's bio
    * username: a string holding the username of the account
