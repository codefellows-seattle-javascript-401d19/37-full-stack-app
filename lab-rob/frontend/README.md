## How to use?

Clone this repo, `cd` into `lab-rob/frontend`, run `npm i` to install dependencies. 

  If all you want to do is use the site, simply open `/lab-rob/build/index.html` using live-server or nodemon. Don't forget to start the backend as well.

If you want to make and see your changes, make sure you have `webpack-dev-server` installed globally with `npm i webpack-dev-server -g`. Type `npm run watch` to start a live-server. Webpack will tell you the url of the site, but it will most likely be `localhost:8080`. You can now make changes to the file and see them rendered to the page. Make sure to start the backend as well.
