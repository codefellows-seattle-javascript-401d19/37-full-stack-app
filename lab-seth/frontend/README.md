# 36#: Budget & Expect Tracker with React & Redux & Middleware and a Full BackEnd Database
This app allows a user to input a category, budget for that category, and individual expense for each category through two basic forms and save it to the state of of the landing, where it dynamically gets rendered to the page using React. The Category can be updated or deleted once created using the same form, as well as each expense.

## Features
This app uses middleware to create a chain on commands for error catching and logging for changes to the state through Redux.
There is a backend that takes all the CRUD requests for the database and loads the database onto the page if there are items in it.

## Tech / Framework
- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- Javascript
- VS Code

## Usage
1.) In terminal navigate to the lab-seth folder.

2.) ```npm install``` the modules required

3.) ```npm run build``` to build the files for transpiling

4.) ```npm run watch``` to launch a local server to see the app @ **localhost:8080** in a browser.
